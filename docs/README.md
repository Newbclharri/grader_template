# Grader Template

## Notes:
- This template runs code from the main code base in the app directory by using a google scripts library in the template Apps Script code editor
- You can create a library version by clicking Deploy/New deployment/Select type/Library
- Then select the settings cog from left panel and copy the script ID into your template Apps Script project.
- This method is recommended if you decide to clone the project and use your own base code as a Google Apps Script library
